Hi there, I'm Kunal, and I'm passionate about exploring the world and all the amazing cultures it has to offer. When I'm not busy planning my next adventure, you can usually find me working on my latest IT project.

I've spent several years in the field, with experience both as a Technical Account Manager and a Network Engineer. As a T.A.M., I honed my skills in client communication, problem-solving, and project management, while as a Network Engineer, I developed a deep understanding of network design, implementation, and troubleshooting.

But my true passion lies in cybersecurity, and I'm currently working towards becoming a specialist in the field. I'm particularly interested in threat analysis, incident response, and ethical hacking, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
