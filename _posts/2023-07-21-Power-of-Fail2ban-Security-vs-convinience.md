Fail2ban, a versatile and powerful intrusion prevention tool, has garnered both acclaim and caution in the realm of server security. As a guardian of our digital fortresses, it relentlessly watches for malicious actors attempting to breach our defenses, often resulting in the swift banning of suspicious IP addresses. However, in certain scenarios, Fail2ban's zealous protection might inadvertently catch legitimate users in its crossfire. As a result, some administrators hesitate to embrace it, fearing that it might lead to locking out users who may have merely forgotten their passwords. This article explores the benefits of Fail2ban, why it might not always be implemented, and how it can be effectively utilized in isolated server environments with known user IPs or static VPNs, creating a fine balance between enhanced security and user convenience.


# Installing Fail2ban on CentOS and Ubuntu:

	## CentOS:

		### Install Fail2ban:

```
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install fail2ban
```

	## Enable and start Fail2ban service:

```
    sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
    sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```
	## Ubuntu:

		### Install Fail2ban:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fail2ban
```
	## Enable and start Fail2ban service:

```
    sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
    sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

# Configuring Fail2ban:

	The Fail2ban configuration file is located at /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf. Before you do anything, create a copy in the same directory and name it /etc/fail2ban/jail.local. You will be editing this LOCAL file. You can create and edit this file as follows:

		## Create a copy and open the configuration file:

```
sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

	Each service which will be protected by fail2Ban is called a Jail. So for example to protect ssh service, you will edit the SHH jail, which will be under  [sshd]


	Customize the settings according to your needs. For example, to enable the SSH jail, modify the [sshd] section as follows:

	# Find the jail and add the enabled true parameter like below. 
```
    [sshd]
    enabled = true
```
	# Setting Parameters for Blocked IP:

You can adjust the ban parameters to fine-tune Fail2ban's behavior. This will be at the beginning of the file.  Key parameters include:

    maxretry: The number of failed login attempts before banning an IP.
    bantime: The duration (in seconds) an IP will be banned (set to -1 for indefinite).
    findtime: The time window (in seconds) within which maxretry attempts are counted.

	# Checking Fail2ban Logs and Banned IP List:

To check if Fail2ban has banned any IPs and view the bans, use the following commands:

    View Fail2ban logs:

```
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/fail2ban.log
```

	List banned IP addresses:

```
    sudo fail2ban-client status
```
	
	To remove a specific IP ban, you can use:

```
sudo fail2ban-client set <jail_name> unbanip <ip_address>
```

Conclusion:

Fail2ban is an indispensable tool for securing servers and preventing unnecessary bans caused by malicious activities. By automatically detecting and blocking suspicious IP addresses, Fail2ban ensures enhanced server security, reduces support ticket loads, and minimizes user inconvenience. With straightforward installation, configuration, and monitoring, Fail2ban serves as the guardian of your server's safety, giving you peace of mind and greater control over your server environment.
